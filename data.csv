1;1000;9;dot_navigation;Male;25;3;771;0;29.333333333333332;100;100;Dot navigation was really easy to use for me.;Because I can see an overview of the route, I did not have to look down on the phone too much. ;If there was a long, straight part of the route, I was able to focus on my surroundings instead of the phone. ;I very much prefer dot navigation to turn-by-turn navigation because you can see the start and the end of the route. ;If there was a unclear turn that I could hardly identify when overviewing the whole route, I could simply zoom in in order to find the right way to turn to, for example by identifying nearby shops. 
2;1050;9;dot_navigation;Male;28;4;768;0;33.666666666666664;100;100;The experience (turn-by-turn navigation) was pretty frustrating because I'm used to use the dot navigation.;I had to look down at my device all the time. This was also dangerous at some point, for example at the bus station where there were two buses and I was still looking down on my device.;Never really had an overview of where I was going to, so I always just saw the next steps which was quite confusing.;If there was a straight part of the route, you couldn't see where exactly the next turn was because the map was zoomed in. ;I would use it (turn-by-turn navigation) in my car but not when I'm walking, I think its really not the best way to navigate if you use it walking.
3;1000;7;guided_navigation;Male;27;3;734;0;16;85.7;85.7;The participant was familiar with the navigation technique (guided navigation).;The navigation method (guided navigation) improved, since the participant used it a few years ago. The participant always felt source that he is heading in the right direction.;The participant had no problems while navigating. At some point a car was parked on the route. But nevertheless the participant managed to follow the intended route.;Most of the time the participant uses the dot navigation method because he then sees the endpoint of the route. When you use to guided navigation you have to trust the app to lead you to the destination because you only see the next step.;The participant would you the guided navigation method in case he is not familiar with the environment. For example in a big city.
4;900;7;guided_navigation;Female;26;4;654;1;24.67;100;100;She prefers dot navigation because with the guided navigation she cannot have an overview of the whole road and it make most difficult to find the right path when she gets lost;The dot navigation is more intuitive ;She did a mistake because she was confusing because the road seems straight on the map, but it was not that straight in reality ;She corrected herself when she made the mistake because she saw that there were still 100 meters to go before turning right;Road easy to follow as there is not much traffic in the city 
5;1060;8;dot_navigation;Male;25;4;726;0;34.67;75;75;He's quite content about not making any errors, which he also didn't commit. Thus, he must be quite comfortable using this kind of navigation. He also regularly uses the app this way. ;"The route was considered easy to follow due to a longer path in the middle. Potentially, the ""stress points"" have been too close to each other. ";He thinks dot navigation is easier, because you have a sense of overall orientation as the complete route is visible on the map. Also he has more experience to use the app this way. Thus, it might explain why he didn't commit any errors while walking. ;In the beginning he had some issues to orientate himself to find the correct direction to start to walk. This might not have happened with the other navigation method, because it is pointed out very obviously. Sometimes the zoom function had to be used to get a closer look at the route. This way the dot navigation method becomes more like the turn navigation method, which could impact the collected data. ;He has already been familiar with the surroundings and usually uses the dot navigation in these settings. Thus, in a completely unfamiliar environment he would have had more problems to navigate.
6;1000;9;guided_navigation;Male;26;4;662;1;20.666666666666664;100;100;I was a little confused, sometimes the pointer would point in the wrong direction.;When I use google map I usually use the dot navigation.; I made a mistake, I followed a path that more or less went in the right direction, but there being two and not paying enough attention I chose the wrong one.;I was looking too far ahead on the road and not paying enough attention to where I really was.;I prefer spot navigation. So knowing where to go and just having hints from the map. If I take a wrong turn I don't care, I can correct myself knowing what my final destination is.
7;1000;8;dot_navigation;Male;25;4;652;0;25.67;0.625;0.6;I usually hold my phone in my hands when navigating, but because of the cold, I kept it in my pocket as much as possible. ;The GPS pointer jumped onto a building, so I thought I took the wrong route. In the end, it turned out to just be a GPS issue. ;I really like and prefer the dot navigation over others. I have control over where I am and can move and zoom to my position. ;I usually turn and move the map in my walking direction. ;I always use the dot navigation when I walk. However, not in situations where I cannot move on the map e.g. cycling/driving. 
8;1000;9;guided_navigation;Male;22;4;666;0;31.3333333;100;100;Route was manageable with navigation.;Some issues with navigation method, GPS did not work well and therefore visuals were off.;Do not like navigation because needed to hold phone in hand, so those got really cold.;Navigation did not work in realtime because of missing GPS sometimes, but did not hinder from walking the route.;Would not use it, prefers dotted navigation for personal use, as this gives him overview over total route.
9;1001;9;guided_navigation;Male;23;4;737;1;15.33;75;100;I'd say we were very lucky with the weather and had a nice stroll. ;I use the guided navigation, and I found a bit difficult at times because it kept turning on the screen in a direction, which wasn't really most beneficial to my route.;"Yeah, I mean since the weather is pretty cold right now and my shoes are not the most robust at the moment, 
it was a bit slippery at times but I think mostly it was fine.";Yeah I think outside of the experiment, I wouldn't really use it [Guided Navigation], at least not for walking roads. ;I would use it [Guided Navigation] when I'm on my motorcycle, for example.
10;950;7;dot_navigation;Male;25;4;866;1;22.33;85.7;80;The participant stated that the starting point of the route was unknown to him.;The participant stated that he was missing reminders of upcoming turns during the navigation.;The participant stated that he already knew the area (i.e., downtown St. Gallen).;The participant stated that he sometimes was distracted by environmental factors (e.g., Christmas market, approaching truck).;The participant would not use dot navigation while hiking due to longer distances between turns or jogging because he has to concentrate on jogging (not in the audio file, follow-up question).
11;1000;5;dot_navigation;Male;25;4;831;0;20;100;100; It wasn’t difficult.; It was cold, so I always had my cell phone in my hand. That has tugged at my well-being.; I found the dot navigation very good, very comprehensible.; Google Maps showed me the wrong route.;  I wouldn't do this by car (dot navigation) because there are no lanes displayed, but on foot it's handy because you see the bird's eye view.
12;1200;8;guided_navigation;Male;25;3;778;0;32;62.5;100;One challenge I faced was that I sometimes didn't quite know how long I still had to walk until I needed to make a turn. My app sometimes had issues displaying how far away a turn still was, so it changed e.g. the meters very quickly before a turn and it went from 50m to 5m in a moment.;A problem with the navigation method was, that you're really guided the entire way and you don't really have the overview of where you need to go. You just follow what you're told.  ;The navigation method entices you to just follow instructions instead of thinking for yourself. ;I would use this navigation method when the conditions aren't that hard, so not really in a downtown area.;I would use this navigation method if I truly trust it to be correct and don't have the feeling of needing to monitor that the changes of direction truly are correct and that I can just follow its instructions. 
13;1000;8;dot_navigation;Female;25;5;772;1;40;75;100;It was not always clear to the subject which way to take when there were multiple paths very close by. However, strictly following the Dot Navigation helped.;The weather presented a real challenge, as there was heavy snowfall during the route. The subject had to hold an umbrella to keep the smartphone possibly dry and still try to look out for real world obstacles.;Generally, the Dot Navigation was considered pleasant, as it suggested more control for navigating the city compared to the Guided Navigation, which feels more constraining.;For navigating inside a close city, the Dot Navigation was considered agreeable, as it leaves more freedom to move and take decisions, e.g. where to cross a street.;With the bad weather conditions, the subject would have preferred a Guided Navigation with voice instructions to dedicate more of the concentration and vision on the city instead on the smartphone screen. Also when navigating with a vehicle, she would have preferred Guided Navigation.
14;1100;7;dot_navigation;Female;23;4;779;0;8.95;100;100;As a whole, the experience was great.;The objective of the experience was clear.;The experiment was easy and no mistake was made, this is because Léonore thinks St.Gallen is a city without many traffics and there are many roads for pedestrians, which made the experiment easier.;She prefers dot navigation to guided navigation in her daily life because sometimes she just needs the information but doesn’t want to exactly follow the instructions provided by the map. However, sometimes she will also use guided navigation to see how much time is left for the route.;She usually uses navigation when she visits somewhere for the first time, for example, when she is travelling.
15;1200;9;dot_navigation;Male;22;4;1085;0;31.3;77.7;77.7;The dot navigation gave a good estimate of where to go.;The participant uses the satellite version of Google Maps.;The participant is confident with using the dot navigation because he usually uses it anyways.;The participant would use the dot navigation every time he has to go somewhere by foot.;The participant had no problems with the route or the navigation system at all.
16;1100;8;guided_navigation;Male;26;3;941;2;21.67;87.5;87.5;Overall, the participant described the experience as pleasant and kind of familiar, with the exception of the guided navigation mode which he never made use of before. Even though the navigation mode was new to the participant, he was positively surprised by it.;During the experiment, he has often put the phone back into his pocket whenever the route lead through a straight road. As soon as the participant arrived at an intersection, the phone vibrated to indicate that there is another turn that needs to be taken. Although this is a nice feature of the application, it is unclear whether this component distorts the outcome of this experiment since there is no comparable feature in the ”dot” navigation mode.;At the very beginning of the experiment, just after starting the navigation mode within the app, the map was displayed top down on the participants screen. However, since he already knew in which direction the route will commence, he did not get confused by this issue.;Almost at the end of the route, the participant at one point did not immediately realize a change of direction. Therefore, he needed to go back a few meters to head back to the correct path. The reason for this error might be related to the participant relying on the vibration in his pocket, as he states.;The participant stated that in the future he would probably rather use the ”dot” navigation method. However, the guided navigation mode seemed useful to him in cases where he would not want to watch his phone during the entire route. Again, relying on the vibration feature that is part of the guided navigation mode. He would probably prefer the guided navigation mode in case he would go on a hike or jogging.
17;1000;8;dot_navigation;Male;24;4;785;0;46.66;100;100;It was a very pleasant experience as I use this function a lot. It was very cold to carry out the experiment as I had to stay focus on the slippery road. Since I have the primary rheumatoid disease, I couldn't feel my fingers because of the cold.;I really like the navigation method a lot. Simple and easy to use. I really appreciate the directional function. I could reach my destination without any big problems;Sometimes I wasn't so sure which way to exactly go. It was rather imprecise;I would only use this method when I’m walking somewhere, otherwise it would be not precise.;-
18;1300;8;guided_navigation;Male;26;4;2544;0;46.66;100;100;It was pretty cold outside, especially holding my cellphone in my hands the whole time. The road was sometimes very slippery, and I had to concentrate very much on the navigation and at the same time how to walk without slipping.;I used the guided navigation. It was unfamiliar to me to use that method as I’ve always used the dot navigation but all in all, it was good and handy to use. I could also reach my destination;I had the feeling that the pointer sometimes did not work properly. It was less precise in narrow streets;I would use this method if I am traveling by car or bike. I can also imagine that I use this method when the dot method doesn't work.;-
19;1000;9;guided_navigation;Male;26;3;765;0;27.66;100;100;Accuracy of the map was not very good. Usually it is better.;Indicator was on the wrong position multiple times and therefore needed to look individually for right turns.;Normally uses dot navigation and don’t like this navigation for walking. Would use this method for driving or cycling.;Google tells to cross a street illegally.;It was cold during the experiment. Could not wear gloves because he needed to use the screen.
20;1000;6;dot_navigation;Male;24;3;936;1;43.66666666666667;100;62.5;The participant had some trouble understanding when Google Maps wanted them to cross a big street. This led to them walking too far down the road before crossing. This was the cause of the one error recorded during the experiment.;The participant says that the dot navigation method allows you to easily get back to the original route as you can zoom out and easily see how to get back. The user is participant to this method. This might be why they got so quickly back to the correct route. ;The participant was not familiar with the route at all. This could also be a reason for why the participant went too far and made the error. If they had been familiar with the route they would probably have known where to cross.;The participant is not used to having to press the button at crossovers. This led to them standing at a red light at the first crossing with pedestrian traffic lights for quite some time before realising they had to press the button. This definitely added to the time taken to finish the route. ;The participant mentioned that it was cold outside. This could mean that they had their hands in their pocket for longer and therefore looked less at their phone to glance at the route. This could also therefore have contributed to the one error made. 
21;950;8;dot_navigation;Male;22;4;745;1;49;100;100;There was snow and ice outside and it was cold. Without that, walking would have been easier.;I always use the dot navigation so i am quite used to it.;Using the dot navigation, one does not need to have the phone at hand all the time. This is especially benefitial with cold weather.;The route was not super easy, because there were some smaller routes in the city center of St.Gallen you had to find. I had to double check sometimes.;I prefer the dot navigation over the guided one and have the feeling i can recall routes better using dot navigation.
